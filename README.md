# Diabetes-Readmission-Prediction-Federated-TabTransformer
This project predicts 30-day hospital readmission in diabetic patients using the Diabetes 130-US Hospitals dataset. It combines TabTransformer for tabular learning, Federated Learning (FedAvg) for privacy-preserving multi-hospital training, and SHAP/LIME for interpretable clinical decision support
